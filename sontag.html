Many ethical issues with photographing are presented through the chapter, such as nonintervention. She believes we are being consumed by the compulsion to photograph, and it at times takes the authenticity out of our experience, stating, &ldquo;Today everything exists to end in a photograph.&rdquo; In some ways I agree with her assessment of photography. I have found throughout my life that at times the viewfinder of the camera puts a wall up between me and the real world in front of me. The moments I&#39;m experiencing can at times become more about the photograph than truly living in that moment. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;I have been a photographer since I was 13, when I bought my first point-and-shoot film camera at a local garage sale for 5 dollars. For me, taking photos has always been a form of journaling. I have always been a nostalgic person, and photographing the world around me was a way to physically eternalize a moment or person in my life. I remember my past through the lens of my camera, which I witnessed it from. Susan Sontag mentions this idea in the text on page 15. &ldquo;It is a nostalgic time right now, and photographs actively promote nostalgia.&rdquo; On page 15 she also says, &ldquo;An ugly or grotesque subject may be moving because it has been dignified by the attention of the photographer.&rdquo;I really resonated with the statement because I share a similar philosophy in the way I use my camera. I believe that taking a photograph of something or someone can be seen as an act of love, and that feeling can be felt through an image, which makes the subject inherently beautiful regardless of what you are capturing. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">On page 20 Sontag says, &ldquo;To suffer is one thing; another thing is living with the photographed images, which does not necessarily strengthen conscience and the ability to be compassionate.&rdquo; This statement feels almost prophetic considering the world we live in today. We have become so immune to the shock of witnessing atrocities through photographs that many people seem to have lost the ability to be compassionate and empathetic toward other people in the world. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I think using photography and visual art in general is an incredibly powerful way to represent the current state of our world. By using visual art, you are able to share how you see the world. For example, visual art can be statements on many pressing topics in our world, like social issues, nature, identity, emotions, technology, and more. I believe any piece of art you create inherently depicts how you see the world in some way. Sharing your art for other people to consume is incredibly important because it allows for everyone to express their unique point of view and opens up conversation for very important and relevant themes that are present in our world.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p></body></html>

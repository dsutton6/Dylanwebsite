  <h1> Dylans Portfolio</h1>
  <p>Dylan Sutton is a Brooklyn based artist working through the mediums of Filmmaking, Photography, and Narrative fiction Screenwriting. I view my camera as a tool to eternalize and archive my world and the people who inhabit it by capturing their essence with a tenderness and authenticity. Inspired greatly by the concept of time, through my work I strive to immerse the viewer in a sense of nostalgia and intimacy. Although I capture moments spontaneously in the moment, I hope for my photography and films to feel like the recalling of a forgotten memory or the small overlooked moments in between the big ones, that linger in your mind. 
 </p>
  <p>My artistic process is very intuitive, and instinctual. I am very selective with my photos and it often takes me weeks or sometimes months to finish a single roll of film. I never leave my home with the intention of having a photo shoot. Rather I wait for the perfect moment I feel I would like to remember and eternalize to present itself. i am a current student at Hunter college working on a degree in Media Studies and Documentary production. i hope to wortk within the film industry post grad and eventually direct my own films.</p>
